## Project thoughts

I honestly don't know exactly what I want to do my final project on, but I might want to do something relating to voting participation trends in municipal elections. In another class I'm taking called Gov 1433, my professor works at the Public Interest Tech Lab and she mentioned that they have the largest collection of voting and elections data in the country. She suggested that I might do a project with the data for my home state, Florida, or for my county. I might do that, but I'm going to keep trying to think of something more interesting and unique!
