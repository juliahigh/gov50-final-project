In concrete terms, this involves a sum of 200 million euros from the federal government and the airports' holding costs from March to the end of June 2020. In addition, the federal government is putting around 400 million euros into the three airports with federal participation, in addition to Berlin, these are Munich and Cologne-Bonn. The preconditions for federal support are that the respective federal states provide a subsidy in the same amount, that no dividends are distributed for 2020 and that no bonuses are paid to managing directors and board members of the operating companies. In addition, the Federal Government will support small airports in connection with air navigation services. To this end, a second charging area supported with federal funds is to be created for aerodromes that do not belong to those under § 27d para. 1 of the Air Traffic Act, but where air navigation services are recognised as necessary. Up to now, small airports have borne the costs of air traffic control themselves and cannot always pass them on to airspace users. 20 million euros have been earmarked for this support measure in the 2021 budget. DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung GmbH (air navigation services) will receive equity support of €300 million in 2021.

Moreover, in the majority of cases, beneficiaries will be selected through competitive bidding processes. In particular, tenders are organised per technology, including a newly introduced separation of rooftop and ground based solar photovoltaic, and separate tenders for biomethane. Moreover, innovation tenders for projects spanning several technologies will also be organised, allowing for a certain degree of technological neutrality and to gather experience on how to make electricity production from RES installations less intermittent. Finally, as biomass and onshore wind tenders have been regularly undersubscribed in the past, the EEG 2021 contains clear safeguards for tenders to be competitive, therefore unfolding their full potential to avoid overcompensation and to keep costs to a minimum for consumers and taxpayers.

The target scenario is taken as a basis. The scenarios differ in sets of measures to decarbonize the Russian economy.
The macroeconomic conditions of the target scenario assume a faster growth rate of non-energy exports - up to 4.4% annually. The contribution to the sustainable growth of the economy will be made by both the outpacing growth rates of investments in fixed assets (3.7% annually) and the stable growth of real disposable income (2.5% annually). At the same time, a more moderate drop in energy exports from 2030 is expected than in the inertial scenario, including due to the reorientation to high-value-added products and the implementation of measures to increase the competitiveness of Russian energy exports in foreign markets. As a result, the annual growth rates of the economy remain above the global average until 2050 (up to 3% per year), the Cabinet of Ministers emphasizes.
The implementation of the target scenario will require investments in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the amount of about 1% of GDP in 2022-2030 and up to 1.5-2% of GDP in 2031-2050. Among the decarbonization measures announced are the provision of support measures for the introduction, replication and scaling of low- and carbon-free technologies, promotion of the use of secondary energy resources, changes in tax, customs and budget policies, the development of green financing, measures to preserve and increase the absorption capacity of forests and other ecosystems, support for technologies for capturing, using and disposing of greenhouse gases.
Thus, within the framework of the target scenario, economic growth will be possible with a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions: by 2050 by 60% from the level of 2019 and by 80% from the level of 1990. Further implementation of this scenario will allow Russia to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060.

The proposed rule would reduce 41 million tons of methane emissions from 2023 to 2035, the equivalent of 920 million metric tons of carbon dioxide. That’s more than the amount of carbon dioxide emitted from all U.S. passenger cars and commercial aircraft in 2019.

This aims at keeping bills as low as possible, driving the UK towards its goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, and helping turn the UK into the ‘Silicon Valley’ of energy.
The fund, which opens for application on 31st August, is part of Ofgem’s RII02 price controls for the electricity system operator and the network companies that operate GB’s energy pipes and wires. The fund will be approved by Ofgem and managed in partnership with Innovate UK.
£450 million will initially become available over the next five years through the fund, with the option to increase in response to need and if innovators bring forward strong plans. Together, network companies, system operators, and the world’s leading businesses and researchers will use this money to drive big ideas that accelerate the transition to an emissions-free energy system and at the same time help to position the UK as a world leader in energy innovation. 
To apply for the first round of funding, network companies must address four major strategic challenges that are crucial for the energy transition. These are:
- Whole system integration
- Data and digitalisation
- Heat
- Transport
Projects could range from ensuring the networks are ready to roll out clean heating solutions such as heat pumps to Britain’s homes to developing ways for network companies to work together across transmission, distribution, system operation, gas and electricity. Projects could also include developing new technologies for networks to support flexible energy solutions, such as battery storage technology, to ensure electricity is used and stored more effectively, thereby bringing down bills and emissions.

The first phase of the investment corresponds to USD 3.5 billion and is reported as such here. The volume of gas resources in the field is estimated at 200 trillion cubic feet of rich raw gas, which will provide a valuable feedstock for the petrochemical industries.

The Company expects the field’s production, to commence early 2024, to reach approximately 2.2 billion standard cubic feet per day of sales gas by 2036, with an associated approximately 425 million standard cubic feet per day of ethane, representing about 40 percent of current production. The Company also expects the field to produce approximately 550 thousand barrels per day of gas liquids and condensates.

Development of the field over 22 years should provide the government a net income of about 32 billion riyals annually and contribute 75 billion riyals to the kingdom’s gross domestic product according to the Saudi press Agency.

Aramco is keen on developing domestic gas production in order to shift from crude oil to gas exports and to use gas domestially for power generation and as an industrial feedstock.","https://www.aramco.com/en/news-media/news/2020/jafurah-gas-field

It increases the Additional Income Tax (AIT) on hydrocarbon extraction. The measure was passed in parallel with the so called ""completion of the tax manouvre"" of the upstream oil and gas sector, initiated several years ago, and adoption of some additional tax benefits for the upstream oil and gas industry in 2020 (e.g. Federal Laws #65, #340). So the cumulative effect is mixed. Independent estimates of the increased tax burden on the oil and gas extractive industry vary. For example, the Renaissance capital puts it at at RUB 260 billion for 2021, equivalent to 3.3% of the government’s tax take in 2019 from the Russian oil and gas sector. The tax burden is expected to increase mainly on LUKOIL, Surgutneftegaz and Tatneft, while ""national champions"" Rosneft and, to a lesser extent, Gazprom secured additional tax benefits in 2020 that help to mitigate the impact of these Tax Code Amendments.

The law paves the way for a EUR 40 billion support programme for the economic transformation of coal regions and legislation to compensate coal plant operators for shutting down capacity. In particular, the Act stipulates that a total of EUR 4.35 billion in compensation will be paid for the planned shutdowns by 2030 (see separate entry in the Tracker). Further, the government would introduce adaptation payments for older workers in lignite mines and hard coal and lignite power plants who lose their jobs due to the coal exit plans, with a budget of up to EUR 5 billion by 2048. The Coal Phase-Out Act was passed 18 months after the issue of multi-stakeholder Coal Exit Commission's recommendations, so it has its roots well before the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis and government responses to it.
